# Simulating-Polyas-Urn
FINM 34000 (Autumn 2023)

Polya's urn problem is a classic problem in probability theory and stochastic processes.

Problem Statement:
You have an urn containing balls of two different colors, say red and green. You start with an initial configuration of the urn, where you know the number of red and green balls (in this example, one red and one green ball). At each step, you randomly select a ball from the urn, note its color, and then return it to the urn along with an additional ball of the same color. The newly added ball has the same color as the one just drawn.

The question is: What is the probability distribution of the colors of the balls in the urn after a large number of such steps?

As demonstrated by my code, upon doing multiple iterations for each trial, along with simulating multiple trials, one should expect a fairly uniform distribution!
